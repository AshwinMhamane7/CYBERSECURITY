# CYBERSECURITY 
EASY TO UNDERSTAND HARD TO DO SO READ CAREFULLY.

WE CAN LEARN HERE CYBERSECURITY(BASIC TO ADVANCE)

Introduction to Defensive Security:-
Offensive security focuses on one thing: breaking into systems. Breaking into system, exploiting bugs, absuing insecure setup, taking advantags of access control policies.
* Red Teams and penetration testers Specializes in Offensve security.
* Blue teasms are part of defensive security They are helping organizations to protect against various attcks that target their systems

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems.
Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly.
Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it won’t be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to know.

# Area of defensive security
Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. 
Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is not available, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is of vital interest to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them.

Policy violations: We can think of a security policy as a set of rules required for the protection of the network and systems. For example, it might be a policy violation if users start uploading confidential company data to an online storage service.

Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a user’s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC needs to detect such an event and block it as soon as possible before further damage is done.

Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.
